Trunk is an open source package manager and registry for PostgreSQL (Postgres) extensions:

- Visit [pgt.dev](https://pgt.dev) to discover and learn more about the building blocks of this rich ecosystem 
- Use the Trunk CLI ([pg-trunk](https://crates.io/crates/pg-trunk)) to build, publish and install Postgres extensions _of all kinds_.

## Trunk CLI

### Installation
To get started, run the following commands to download and leverage cargo to install Trunk's CLI.
1. `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
2. `cargo install pg-trunk`

### Usage

The Trunk CLI allows for building, publishing and installing Postgres extensions of all kinds. It abstracts away
complexities of extension development and management with the following commands:

### `trunk build`
Compile extensions of all kinds.

```shell
❯ trunk build
Building from path .
Detected that we are building a pgrx extension
Detected pgrx version range 0.7.4
Using pgrx version 0.7.4
Building pgrx extension at path .
.
.
.
Creating package at: ./.trunk/pgmq-0.5.0.tar.gz
Create Trunk bundle:
	pgmq.so
	extension/pgmq--0.5.0.sql
	extension/pgmq.control
	manifest.json
Packaged to ./.trunk/pgmq-0.5.0.tar.gz
```

### `trunk publish`
Publish extensions to the registry, making them available to the Postgres community for discovery and installation.

```shell
❯ trunk publish pgmq \
--version 0.5.0 \
--description "Message Queue for postgres" \
--documentation "https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq" \
--repository "https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq" \
--license "Apache-2.0" \
--homepage "https://www.tembo.io"
```

### `trunk install`
Downloads Postgres extensions from the Trunk registry and installs into your environment (only Ubuntu support at this time).

Supports nested dependencies, e.g. installing `extension_a` will automatically install `extension_b` if required.

```shell
❯ trunk install pgmq
Using pg_config: /usr/bin/pg_config
Using pkglibdir: "/usr/lib/postgresql/15/lib"
Using sharedir: "/usr/share/postgresql/15"
Downloading from: https://cdb-plat-use1-prod-pgtrunkio.s3.amazonaws.com/extensions/pgmq/pgmq-0.5.0.tar.gz
Dependencies: ["pg_partman"]
Installing pgmq 0.5.0
[+] pgmq.so => /usr/lib/postgresql/15/lib
[+] extension/pgmq--0.5.0.sql => /usr/share/postgresql/15
[+] extension/pgmq.control => /usr/share/postgresql/15
```

## Trunk Registry - https://pgt.dev
The Trunk registry serves as a community hub for Postgres extensions of all kinds. The Trunk CLI installs extensions and
their dependencies as compiled artifacts from this registry.

- Extension discovery and search
- Publish extensions for community use
- Install extensions in Postgres

It's our goal to develop Trunk to allow for:

- Usage metrics to provide insight into popular and well-maintained extensions
- Version tracking and new release email notifications

## ✨ Contributing
Trunk is in active development, and we look forward to the contributions the Postgres community has to offer.
